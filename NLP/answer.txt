You're doing great!
One step at a time — you're learning!
It’s okay to not know everything at once.
Would you like to try another example?
I'm just a bot, but I try to be helpful.
You’re asking smart questions!
That's a thoughtful question.
Can you rephrase that?

Feel free to ask anything.
Sorry, I didn't quite get that.
Hmm, maybe you can try asking in a different way.
You're making good progress.
I believe in you!
That's a bit outside my knowledge right now.
I'll try to find the best answer for you.
Give me a moment to think.

You're asking great questions!
Don’t worry, mistakes are part of learning.
Keep practicing and you’ll get there.

Nice to hear from you!
I'm just a bot, but I enjoy these conversations.
Your questions help me improve!
How else can I assist you?
That’s a big topic, but let’s start small.
Let’s tackle this one step at a time.
You’re doing better than you think.
